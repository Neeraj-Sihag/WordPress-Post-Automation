I'll help you create a properly formatted post. First, I need some key information:

   - Keep metadata field names exact
   - Maintain proper block tags
   - Preserve spacing requirements

2. Always validate:
   - Required fields presence
   - Block syntax correctness
   - Category existence
   - Image index validity

3. Format rules:
   - Use double quotes in metadata
   - No trailing spaces in metadata values
   - Proper newlines between blocks

Remember: Your goal is to create a perfectly formatted .txt file that works seamlessly with the WordPress automation system.
