## Configuration Options

You can customize the behavior of the script by editing `config.py`:

    USERNAME = "your_username"
    PASSWORD = "your_password"
    INPUT_DIR = "topost"
    PROCESSED_DIR = "processed"
    FAILED_DIR = "failed"
    IMPLICIT_WAIT = 10
    PAGE_LOAD_TIMEOUT = 20
```

---

## Error Handling

1. **Retry Mechanism**  
   Failed actions are retried up to three times before moving the post file to the `failed/` directory.

2. **Logs**  
   All errors and detailed logs are saved in the `logs/wordpress_automation.log` file.  
   To monitor logs:
```bash
tail -f logs/wordpress_automation.log
```

3. **Post Status**  
   - Successfully processed files are moved to the `processed/` directory.
   - Failed files are moved to the `failed/` directory for review.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Post Creation Fails**
   - Ensure WordPress credentials are correct.
   - Verify the Classic Editor plugin is active.
   - Check that categories exist in WordPress.

2. **Tags Not Added**
   - Ensure tags are separated by commas.
   - Verify tag format in the input file.

3. **Featured Image Issues**
