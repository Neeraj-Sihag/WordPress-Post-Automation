## How It Works

This tool processes `.txt` files in the `topost/` directory. Each file contains **metadata** and **content blocks**. The structure is designed to work seamlessly with WordPress automation.

### Post File Format
Every post file follows this structure:

```plaintext
# --- Metadata ---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "Brief description of the post"
slug: "custom-slug"
featured_image: "1"             # Media library index
category: "Technology"
tags: "Python, Automation, WordPress"
author: "1"                     # WordPress user ID
status: "publish"               # Options: "publish", "draft", "private"
publish_date: "2024-11-17"      # Leave blank for immediate publishing

## Supported Content Blocks

The tool supports a variety of WordPress content blocks:

- **Paragraphs**:

  Your paragraph content goes here.
  [/paragraph]
  ```

- **Headings (Levels 1-6)**:
  ```plaintext
  [heading level=2]
  Heading Text
  [/heading]
  ```

- **Lists**:

    ```plaintext
    [list type=unordered]

## Time Efficiency

This tool is optimized for both speed and reliability. The typical time taken per post is:

- **90 seconds**: For simple posts with minimal metadata and content blocks.  
- **120 seconds**: For complex posts with featured images, multiple categories, and tags.

Timings include comprehensive checks for metadata validation, content formatting, and automatic retries for transient issues.

We are actively improving performance in upcoming versions to further reduce the processing time without compromising reliability.

## AI Prompt Integration

The `aiprompt.txt` file is a specially designed prompt for generating properly formatted `.txt` files compatible with this automation tool. Paste the contents into any AI model to create post files effortlessly.

### Example Use Case:
1. Open `aiprompt.txt` in your editor.  
2. Copy and paste the contents into an AI system like ChatGPT.  
3. Provide your input (e.g., "Create a post about Python tips").  
4. Receive a perfectly formatted `.txt` file ready for automation.

## Error Handling

1. **Failed Posts**:
   - Moved to the `failed/` directory for review.
   - Logs include detailed error messages.

2. **Retries**:
   - Automatic retries for temporary issues, such as delayed UI rendering.

3. **Logs**:
   - Comprehensive logs are saved in the `logs/` directory for debugging and tracking.
